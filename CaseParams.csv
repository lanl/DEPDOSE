!For subjects, Male = 1, Female = 2, Male15 = 3, Female15 = 4,10 year old = 5,5 year old = 6,1 year old = 7,3 month old = 8
!For activities, Sleep = 1, sitting = 2, light exercise = 3, heavy exercise =4, Standard worker = 5, heavy worker = 6,Member of the public (full day) = 7
!Rho is the mass density of the particle. Recommended value is 3.0 g/cm3
!Shape factor relates the thermodynamic diameter to the aerodynamic diameter (larger values are less spherical). Typical values are between 1 and 2. Recommended value is 1.5
!U is wind speed. Variation within realistic ranges doesn't make much difference. Recommended value is 1.0
!P is atmospheric pressure in cm Hg. 1 atm = 76 cm Hg.
!Chronic indicates whether intake is chronic or acute. If chronic, activities will be weighted by volume. If acute, they will be weighted by time.
!ICRP130 indicates whether to redistribute the activity in ET1 and ET2 according to ICRP130 recommendations
